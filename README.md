# Couchbase REST API Documentation

Project Proposal for Google Season of Docs 2019

Couchbase Server has a [complex set of REST APIs](https://docs.couchbase.com/server/6.0/rest-api/rest-intro.html), which may be used to administer Couchbase Server nodes and clusters, and to query the database.

The REST API is currently documented using static web pages, written in [AsciiDoc](https://asciidoctor.org) and published using [Antora](https://antora.org/).

It's important for users and developers that these reference pages should be kept up to date, with comprehensive instructions and examples.

As part of this project, the Technical Author will work with developers and the documentation team to produce [OpenAPI specification files in YAML format](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/2-0/basic-structure), describing the REST API accurately and completely.

The Technical Author will use [Swagger2Markup](https://github.com/Swagger2Markup) to transform the OpenAPI specifications into static AsciiDoc pages for inclusion in our documentation.
